# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.

- Suppose finding a particular element with binary search in an array of 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of binary search, how long would you guess finding the same element in an
  array of 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.
